This directory contains the necessary tools to
build the Serviceguard Safety timer driver from 
for a specific LINUX operating system.

The safety timer, or deadman, driver is used to 
reboot a node in case of catastrophic cluster 
failure.

A precompiled deadman driver is shipped with the 
Serviceguard product, which is installed during 
the product installation.
 
To build and install the deadman driver separately, 
follow the instructions below:

# make modules
# make modules_install

NOTE: To build the deadman module, kernel sources 
and gcc compiler should be present on the system.
